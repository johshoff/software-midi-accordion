A quick hack to be able to practice accordion while travelling. It runs in the terminal and creates a virtual MIDI-instrument that you can use in any MIDI program, like Garageband.

This is very hard coded for my situation: a US layout keyboard and a type B chromatic button system.

The terminal is not well suited for detecting key releases. It's tested and working in the [Kitty terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
